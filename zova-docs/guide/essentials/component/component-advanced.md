## How to refer to child component instance?

In Zova, `Template Ref` is not used to refer to child component instances, but directly refers to the `controller bean` corresponding to the child component, which can achieve more intuitive and stronger Typescript typing support. See: [Controller Ref](../../vue/refs.md#controller-ref)
