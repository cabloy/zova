# BeanBase

`BeanBase` is the base class for all beans. By inheriting from `BeanBase`, we can easily access commonly used tools and capabilities when writing code

`BeanBase` itself provides some built-in members and allows other modules to inject extended members through the `monkey` mechanism

Zova can be used with any UI library and comes with built-in project templates for several UI libraries, making it easy to use out of the box. Different UI libraries will also inject objects into the `BeanBase` base class according to their own needs
