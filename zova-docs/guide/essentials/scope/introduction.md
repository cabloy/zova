# Module Scope

In Zova, the actual business code development is done in modules. As a relatively independent business unit, the module contains various types of resources: `Config`, `Constant`, `Locale I18n`, `Error exception`, `Api Service`, etc. In order to uniformly manage these resources and facilitate the definition and use of resources, Zova provides the `Scope` object

## Why is Zova's IOC container code more concise?

The reason is to prioritize the use of the `dependency lookup` strategy, resulting in fewer decorator functions and fewer type annotations. Accessing module's resources by the `Scope` object is one of the mechanisms for implementing `dependency lookup` strategies

## How to obtain Scope Instance?

All beans inherit from the base class `BeanBase`, and `BeanBase` supports passing in the generic parameter `ScopeModule`. When the generic parameter `ScopeModule` is passed in, the `Scope` instance of the module to which the current bean belongs can be directly obtained

Take `testA.ts` as an exampleï¼š

```typescript{2,5,7}
import { BeanBase, Local } from 'zova';
import { ScopeModule } from '../.metadata/this.js';

@Local()
export class TestA extends BeanBase<ScopeModule> {
  protected async __init__() {
    console.log(this.scope);
  }
}
```

- The `Scope` instance of the module to which the current bean belongs can be obtained through `this.scope`

## Members of the Scope object

| Name     | Description               |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| config   | Config of Module          |
| constant | Constant of Module        |
| locale   | I18n of Module            |
| error    | Error exception of Module |
| service  | Api Service of Module     |

## How to obtain Scope Instance cross-module?

So, how to obtain `Scope` instances of other modules?

The `Scope` object itself is also a bean, so you can directly use `dependency injection` to obtain `Scope` instances of other modules

Still taking `testA.ts` as an example, obtain the `Scope` instance of the module `home-base`:

```typescript{1,4-5,8}
import { ScopeModuleHomeBase } from 'zova-module-home-base';

export class TestA {
  @UseScope()
  $$scopeModuleHomeBase: ScopeModuleHomeBase;

  protected async __init__() {
    console.log(this.$$scopeModuleHomeBase);
  }
}
```

- Type of `Scope` object imported from module `home-base`
- Use the `UseScope` decorator function
- The system will automatically find the `Scope` instance of the module `home-base` and inject it into the variable `$$scopeModuleHomeBase`

::: info
Based on the support of the compiler, UseScope will automatically switch to asynchronous loading mode. Specifically, the system will asynchronously load the module `home-base`, then obtain the Scope instance of the module, and then inject it
